<h2>Deaccessioning - User Notes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>To deaccession a plant, go to the accession page for that plant
	<ol>
		<li>Change all quantities to 0 (zero)
		<li>Change all locations to 0 (zero)
		<li>Change <b>Currently:</b> to:
		<ul><li>deceased - if plants are dead
			<li>culled - if plants removed for reasons other than death
		</ul>
		<li>Change <b>Assigned to:</b> to <b>DELETE##</b> where ## is year of deaccession
		<ul>
			<li>ie plants deleted in 2020 should be placed in <b>DELETE20</b>
			<li>This allows plants to be (re)accessioned should it be determined they were removed in error
			<br>Reaccessioned plants will retain all historical notations
			<li>Also allows previously researched data to be retained for future use or copying to new accessions of same species
			<li>Drop-down list is auto populated from existing codes
			<ul>
				<li>Each year, a new code will need to be manually entered for first deaccession via commandline as follows:
				<li>Assumes first deaccession for 2021 and first plant to be deaccessioned is 198912345, change those values as required
				<li>From the MySQL command line (local or remote)
				<li><i>update gh_inv set projnum='DELETE21' where codeno = 198912345;</i>
			</ul>
